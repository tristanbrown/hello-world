# "Hello, world!"

My Introduction (10/24/2015)
I am a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison doing research in inorganic chemistry. I have a little bit of experience writing scripts in Scheme, Matlab, and Python for classes, hobbies, and scientific data analysis. I have been very impressed by how powerful, accessible, and expansible Python is, and I would like to learn how to assemble more advanced (and organized!) programming projects with this language.
