# "Hello, world!"

My Introduction (10/24/2015)

I am a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison doing research in inorganic chemistry. I have a little bit of experience writing scripts in Scheme, Matlab, and Python for classes, hobbies, and scientific data analysis. I have been very impressed by how powerful, accessible, and expansible Python is, and I would like to learn how to assemble more advanced (and organized!) programming projects with this language. 

Up to this point, I've been using Python a la carte, but I recently installed the WinPython distribution, so that I can have access to NumPy, SciPy, Cython, and some basic GUI development tools.
